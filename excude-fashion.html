    <h4 class="title">EXCUDE Fashion Magazine</h4>
    <p class="discription" id="Excude-info">For this school project, I had to design a few pages for EXCUDE Fashion. I was assigned to make a cover to show the hitting new fall fashion for that year. I had to create an effective table of contents that continued the fall theme. I had to display a clothing advertisement with any fake clothing line of my choice. Lastly, I created an article page layout for 2021 Fall Fashion.</p>

    <h3 class="title">Revisions</h3>
    <p class="discription">At the end of the school year, my class revisited our projects and made changes based on what we learned over the whole course. I decided to change the cover and article pages. </p>
    <img class="excude-single-img" src="./assets/excude-fashion-readvised.png" alt="the cover page of Excude Fashion readvised to Excude insight" />
    <p class="discription">I decided to change the title of the magazine and its fonts. I  added a barcode to the cover, after all, most magazine covers will have one. I readvised the headlines layout. Before, the headline layout did not have a smooth flow to the eyes. From the first time I did this project, I learned more about spacial reasoning and used that knowledge for an easier flow. </p>

    <p class="discription">The number one thing I noticed on the article page was the drop quote. I decided to pull the drop quote out from the middle of the paragraph. This allowed the reader to flow through the article and gave the drop quote its shining moment. I also changed the alignment for some of the photos. Page a border around the whole page. </p>
